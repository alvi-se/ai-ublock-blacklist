# AI uBlock Origin Blacklist
A personal list containing AI content farms. Pull requests welcome.

## Why?
While browsing it happens sometimes that I come across websites which text is written by generative AI. These website provide no useful information, have mediocre content and are filled up with ads to earn money.
So when I find this kind of website, I put it here.

## How websites are added
If I suspect a website is AI generated, I usually put its content on AI testers like [GPTZero](https://gptzero.me/).
If it is clearly AI written, I check the domain or the blog. If every content is made by AI, then it ends up here.

## My website is on your list!
Cry about it.

- [uBlockOrigin & uBlacklist Huge AI Blocklist](https://github.com/laylavish/uBlockOrigin-HUGE-AI-Blocklist): this projects hides every AI related result from search engines, including
  websites that I believe are legit tools (e.g. ChatGPT). What I want instead is blocking access only to garbage AI content farms.
