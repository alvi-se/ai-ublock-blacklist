## Why?
While browsing it happens sometimes that I come across websites which text is written by generative AI. These websites provide no useful information, have mediocre content and are filled up with ads to earn money.
So when I find this kind of website, I put it here.

## How websites are added
If I suspect a website is AI generated, I usually put its content on AI testers like [GPTZero](https://gptzero.me/).
If it is clearly AI written, I check the domain or the blog. If every content is made by AI, then it ends up here.

## Google Dorks
Because AI users are dumb enough to copy-paste LLM responses without reading them, the LLM will sometimes reveal itself, for example in the intro of the content.
The following are some Google Dorks to find 100% AI generated pages. Such pages will have their whole domain put into the uBlock list.
Dorks can be easily generated by asking an LLM to generate naive content, for example by prompting `Generate an article for my blog about dogs`.
The LLM will answer with an intro like `Sure! Here's an article about`. Take this phrase and search it surrounded by quotes.
```
# English
"Sure! Here's an article about"

# Italian
"Certo! Ecco un articolo"
```

## My website is on your list!
Cry about it.

- [uBlockOrigin & uBlacklist Huge AI Blocklist](https://github.com/laylavish/uBlockOrigin-HUGE-AI-Blocklist): this projects hides every AI related result from search engines, including
  websites that I believe are legit tools (e.g. ChatGPT). What I want instead is blocking access only to garbage AI content farms.
